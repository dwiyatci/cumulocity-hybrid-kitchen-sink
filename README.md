### Why?

**Good guy Glenn**: to venture to the virtue - you don't need a reason to help Earthlings. Just do something good, expect nothing in return. Rely on _serendipity_.

**Bad guy Glenn**: to kill my daily productivity killers as a programmer:

- corporate crap meetings,
- corporate crap emails,
- corporate crap interruptions,
- corporate crap customer calls,
- corporate crap support duties,
- corporate crap under qualified/not-willing-to-learn/annoying Earthlings,
- and other corporate craps in between.

What a jerk, you say? Yes, I'm being a jerk here. ¬¨‚Äø¬¨
